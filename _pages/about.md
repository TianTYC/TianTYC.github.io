Hi!! I'm Tian Yichen. I received my B.E. degree in Software Engineering from Zhengzhou University(2017~2021), China. Currently, I'm working toward an M.S. degree at the College of Intelligence and Computing,  Tianjin University, China, and I will begin a successive postgraduate and doctoral program from September,2023.
Now I'm working on AIOT and wireless sensing at Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking (TANK Lab). Especially, I am interested in indoor localization and multi-modal sensing.

<!-- - This work focuses on single positive multi-label learning (SPML), an extreme of weakly supervised learning problem.
- we choose to treat all unannotated labels from a novel perspective, and hence propose our entropy-maximization loss (with a special gradient regime) and asymmetric pseudo-labeling (with asymmetric-tolerance strategies).
- Our method achieves SOTA results on all four SPML benchmarks and various analyses are provided to verify its effectiveness and rationality. -->
